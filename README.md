## Quiza is a quiz making web-app.

Production version deployed on [Heroku](https://quiza-mokancode.herokuapp.com/).

Created with MERN stack.

## What Quiza offers
People can easily create and share **multiple-choice** quizzes as a study tool. The quizzes can be assigned and searched for by course code, course title, major / field of study, school, term, and teacher/professor.

## Mathematical notation
Quiza supports mathematical notation using [KaTeX](https://katex.org/).

## How to create a quiz
Click on "Create" on the navigation bar. On the quiz creation page, fill out the basic details (name, course title, school, etc.). Add a minimum of 2 questions by clicking the **+** button at the bottom of the page. 
* To add a photo to a question, click the camera icon. 
* To use **math notation**, wrap your math content inside the following tag: **[math] [/math]**
    *  To make things simpler, use **[Symbolab](symbolab.com/)** to form your functions. Then copy and paste the content inside the [math] tag in Quiza.

By default each question has 2 answer choices. To add more choices, click the **+** button under.
**Select the correct answer** for each question by clicking on the circle to the left of the correct answer. Once, clicked it will turn into a **tick icon**.

Your quiz draft will automatically be saved every 3 minutes. Otherwise, you can click on "Save Draft" to save and exit. To find your drafts and posted quizzes later, click on "My Quizzes" on the navigation bar.

Once your quiz is ready, click on "Create". If any detail is missing, the app will notify you.

Once a quiz is posted, you can set its accessibility (or privacy) -- 
* **Public** - Can be found and accessed by anyone. 
* **Private** - Can be found only by entering the quiz's ID in the search form.
* **Hidden** - Can be accessed only by you, the creator.
